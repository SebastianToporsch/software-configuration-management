Calculator Example

	Simple Java Implementation for first test implementations.

* Source Code

	Interface and Implementation Classes, including method signatures in interface and very simple calculation in implementation class.

* Test Code

** Predefined Methods

	Each implementated method should be tested. so the first tests are predefined for quick start.

** Demo Test Method

	there are two finished test methods, which are short demonstrations for testing an implementation. of course, it's very simple, but it fit the needs of test automation and education purpose.
